Assignment Overview:
This assignment involved creating panels to control the red, green, and blue values of a color model using Java Swing. Each panel included sliders, buttons, and text fields to adjust and display color values. The goal was to learn event-driven programming and how to keep the user interface synchronized with the model through listeners.


Technical Impression:
I built three panels (RedRowPanel, GreenRowPanel, and BlueRowPanel) to adjust the corresponding color values. Each panel included buttons to increase or decrease the value, a slider for dynamic adjustments, and a text field for direct input. A JCheckBox enabled or disabled editing of the text field. To keep everything synchronized, I used PropertyChangeListener to update the display when the model changed. Input validation ensured that users could only enter values between 0 and 255. Writing similar functionality for all three panels was repetitive but helped me understand how to structure reusable code and manage event listeners.
